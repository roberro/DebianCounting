								<div> SLOCCount is a set of tools for counting physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) in a large number of languages of a potentially large set of programs. This suite of tools was used in David A. Wheeler's papers
								<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc"> More than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</a>
								and
								<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc">Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</a>
								to measure the SLOC of entire GNU/Linux distributions.
								<a href="http://people.debian.org/~jgb/debian-counting">Others have measured Debian GNU/Linux</a>
								using this tool suite. SLOCCount runs on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and hopefully on other systems too. To run on Windows, you have to install
								<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</a>
								first to create a Unix-like environment for SLOCCount. (text taken from

								<div> Libre Software offers Software Engineering scientists the possibility not only of having a closer look at the product that is being created, but also of studying in detail the whole development process and its technical, social and economic consequences. The
<a href="http://barba.dat.escet.urjc.es/">Libre Software Engineering</a>
project site at GSyC has plenty of information on this topic. </div>

							<div class="cuadro"><b>About other Libre Software analysis tools</b></div>	
								<div> There exist several tools that we use to extract information about the Libre Software development process. These tools are usually Libre Software themselves so that you can download them for free from the Internet, and enhance or modify them to suit your needs. See an
